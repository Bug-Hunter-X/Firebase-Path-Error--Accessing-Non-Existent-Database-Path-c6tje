This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Database interactions: attempting to access a database path that does not exist.  The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces this error, while `bugSolution.js` shows how to handle this scenario gracefully using error handling and conditional checks.

This is a crucial aspect of robust Firebase application development.  Failure to handle these situations can lead to unexpected application crashes and poor user experiences.
