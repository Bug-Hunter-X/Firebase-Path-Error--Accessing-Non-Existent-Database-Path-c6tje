The Firebase SDK may throw an error if it attempts to access a database path that doesn't exist.  This can happen if there's a typo in your path string, or if you're trying to access data that hasn't been created yet.

```javascript
db.ref('incorrectPath/data').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.val()); // This will likely throw an error
});
```
